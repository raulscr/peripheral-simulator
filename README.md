# Peripheral Simulator

This project is a simple Firmware for Microcontroller that uses USB peripheral to simulates USB HID devices, such as keyboards, mouse, etc...  

The project was implemented using C++ language, OOP design patterns and architecture. All classes were decoupled to facilitate future implementations, avoiding code modifications and following SOLID standards.
